# Concepts

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Space Illustration.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Roadmaps and Changelogs are organized in Spaces</p></figcaption></figure>

## Basic concepts

### Product Hub

The Product Hub is a central location listing all Spaces in your organization. The Product Hub can be accessed via the **Apps** menu item in Jira's top navigation bar. &#x20;

### Spaces

The Product Hub contains of one or many Spaces. Spaces typically represent products, teams, projects or even a group of customers. Think of a space as your dedicated area to curate and tailor your messaging for a particular audience.

Each space is equipped with the following features:&#x20;

* A Roadmap to effectively communicate your plans
* A Changelog to share updates
* A Portal to seamlessly disseminate these plans and updates to internal stakeholders or external customers.

### Changelog

A Changelog is a log or record of all notable changes made to a project. The project is often a website or software project, and the changelog usually includes records of changes such as bug fixes, new features, etc.&#x20;

Changelogs serve various purposes, catering to different stakeholders and objectives within a project. They can be utilized for:

1. Detailed Project Updates: Changelogs provide a comprehensive overview of tasks accomplished and bug fixes implemented, offering transparency and insight into the project's development process.
2. Educational Updates: They serve as a valuable resource for sales and other go-to-market teams, informing them about upcoming features and enhancements. This ensures alignment across teams and prepares them to effectively communicate with clients or users.
3. High-Level Marketing Updates: Changelogs can also be repurposed as high-level marketing updates, suitable for sharing with customers either within the application itself or on the project's website. This allows customers to stay informed about the latest improvements and developments, fostering trust and engagement.

### Roadmap

In contrast to the Timeline view or Plans (formerly known as Advanced Roadmaps) in Jira, Released Roadmaps are specifically tailored for communicating plans to stakeholders and customers.&#x20;

One key feature of Roadmaps is their cross-project functionality. This means teams have the flexibility to structure their workflows according to their preferred methods while still being able to aggregate all plans into a single, cohesive roadmap.&#x20;

### Portal

The Portal is your central hub for publishing plans and updates. Easily embed it in your website or app, and link it to Jira projects for quick access by anyone viewing the project.
