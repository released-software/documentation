# Scroll Viewport for Confluence

[Scroll Viewport](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1211636/scroll-viewport-for-confluence?tab=overview\&hosting=cloud) is an Atlassian marketplace app by K15t that allows you to transform your documentation in Confluence into a public or restricted online help center for your users.&#x20;

Released now integrates with Scroll Viewport through their [custom JavaScript inject ](https://help.k15t.com/scroll-viewport/inject-custom-javascript)feature. Setting up this integration is a breeze and requires just a few simple steps, taking less than 5 minutes to complete.

### Prerequisite&#x20;

* [ ] [Find the channel ID](../../how-tos/finding-the-channel-id.md) for the announcement page and note it down.&#x20;

### 1. Create a placeholder page in Confluence&#x20;

1. Create a page where you want the release notes to appear in your Viewport documentation.&#x20;
2. Give the page your preferred name, e.g. "Release Notes".&#x20;
3. Leave the page empty and save.&#x20;

### 2. Note down the Confluence page ID

* [ ] Note down the Confluence **page ID** from the URL (see screenshot below).

### 3. Add the custom JavaScript snippet to your Viewport theme&#x20;

1. Navigate to your Viewport theme settings.
2. [Inject the following JavaScript](https://help.k15t.com/scroll-viewport/inject-custom-javascript).&#x20;

```javascript
if (vp.source.confluencePageId === "PAGE_ID") {
  vp.loadScript('https://embed.released.so/1/embed.js').then(() => {
    document.getElementById("article-content").innerHTML = '<released-page channel-id="CHANNEL_ID" color-scheme="light" color-scheme="light" top-offset="80px" color-primary="#FFF"></released-page>'
  });
}
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Ensure you replace the **Page\_ID** and **CHANNEL\_ID** placeholders with the IDs noted in the previous steps.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

To customize the look and feel of your release notes page, you can add additional parameters to the `<release-page>` tag in the above snippet. For all available settings, see the [announcement-page.md](../settings/announcement-page.md "mention") documentation.&#x20;

3. Lastly, save the changes to your theme.&#x20;

### 4. Optional style fine-tuning&#x20;

By default, Scroll Viewport adds a 10cm padding at the top of the page. To remove the padding on your release page, you can inject the following CSS in the theme settings:

{% hint style="warning" %}
The below code most be added into the **Custom CSS** section. **Not** in the Custom JavaScript section where we added the above code.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

```css
#article-content:has(> released-page)
{
    padding-top:0px;
    grid-template-columns:1fr;
}
```



**Congratulations, you're done ðŸŽ‰**

New posts published with Released will now automatically appear in your Viewport help centre.&#x20;
