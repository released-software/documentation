## Overview

The panel on the right hand side of the post editing view is called the staging area.&#x20;

The staging area makes it a breeze to review issues before they get added to the announcement. Issues are sorted by type, so you can easily spot new features, minor improvements, and bug fixes.

## Basics

### Filter

If you're unable to locate a particular feature that you were expecting to see in the release, don't fret. The filter functionality enables you to customize the display of issues in the staging area.

#### Available filters

<table><thead><tr><th width="260.5">Filter</th><th>Description</th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Done since</strong> </td><td>Include issues moved into the done status category since a specific date. This filter uses the <code>statusCategoryChangedDate</code> to determine the date. </td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Version</strong></td><td>Include issues with a specific version. </td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Label</strong></td><td>Include issues with a specific label.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Issue type</strong></td><td>Include specific types of issues.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Jira Filter</strong></td><td>Include issues that match a given <a href="https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/save-your-search-as-a-filter/">Jira filter</a>.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
