## Overview

The email channel enables you to publish updates and deliver them directly to your users' inboxes. Users can choose to subscribe to your changelog emails on your portal page or widget.&#x20;

### Basics

You can customize how this email feature works with a few simple settings. Here’s a look at the key options available:

#### Enable Subscriptions

When you turn on subscriptions, users can choose to get notifications about new posts. This is a great way to keep your audience engaged and informed about what’s happening. Once they subscribe, they’ll receive emails whenever you publish new content, so they won’t miss a thing!

#### Logo

Adding your space's logo to the email header helps make your messages feel more personal and professional. This setting allows you to include your logo, which can make your emails more recognizable.&#x20;

#### Sender Name

The sender name is how your subscribers will recognize your emails. By customizing this name, you can make that your customers know the email comes from you.&#x20;

#### Reply-To Address

Setting a reply-to address allows subscribers to respond to your updates. This means that when they reply to your emails, their messages will go to a specific address you choose.&#x20;
