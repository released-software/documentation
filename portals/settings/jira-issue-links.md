# Jira issue links

## **Overview**

This feature automatically embeds links to related Jira tickets within your release notes, allowing you to:

* **Identify the specific issues addressed in each release.**
* **Control which channels display these links.**

Most commonly, Jira issue links are shown in internal announcements, offering transparency to team members.&#x20;

## Basics

**Disabling Links in Specific Channels**&#x20;

1. Navigate to Settings > Jira issue links
2. **Disable** the channels where you **don't** want Jira issue links to appear.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This setting only affects **newly published** posts. Previously published posts with embedded links won't be automatically updated. To remove them, simply republish the post.
{% endhint %}
