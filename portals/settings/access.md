## Overview

The access settings allow you to control who can create, publish and view content in the portals.&#x20;

## Visibility

A portal will always be accessible via it's Portal URL, which is the canonical destination to view the portals content. However, who can access the portal can be controlled with the settings below. \
\
With the visibility setting you can further control whether the portal will be listed on the Product Hub or whether it's only reachable directly via the portal URL.&#x20;

## Creator access

Content creation and publishing are restricted to users who have access to the linked Jira projects.

Available access levels are:

* **Open**, everyone with access to the Jira site can view and edit content in the portal.&#x20;
* **Restricted**, only users with access to the linked Jira project(s) can view and edit content in this portal, depending on their level of access in the Jira project(s).&#x20;

If a portal is linked to multiple Jira projects, users must have access to at least one of those projects to access the portal.

Users will only be able to see issues and fields for which they have the necessary permissions.

## Viewer access

Viewer access determines who can view the portal on the Product Hub or when itâ€™s embedded in a website or app.&#x20;

To grant access,  select one of the three available access levels.
