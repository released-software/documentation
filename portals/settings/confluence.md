## Overview

Whether you want to share your post for review, publish it to your knowledge base through a third party app like [Scroll Viewport](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1211636) or [Refined](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1221322/refined-for-confluence-cloud?hosting=cloud\&tab=overview), or give your go-to-market teams a heads up. Publishing to Confluence makes collaboration a breeze.&#x20;

## Basics

### Authentication

Before you can publish content to Confluence, you will need to authenticate.&#x20;

1.  Click the **Authenticate** button.

    Released will ask for permission to view and update content in Confluence on your behalf.&#x20;
2. Select the Confluence site to which you want to publish in the **Authorize for site** dropdown.
3. Click **Accept.**

### Create a Confluence page

Follow these steps to set up a Confluence page for publishing:

1. **Choose a Title**: Decide on a title for your page.
2. **Select a Space**: Determine the space where your page will reside.
3. **Specify a Parent Page**: Choose a parent page under which your new page will be nested. If you skip this step, the page will default to the root of the selected space.
4. Click **Create page**

Once your page is successfully created, your channel is now active. Moving forward, you have a couple of options:

1. **Enable/Disable the channel**: If you prefer not to display this channel in the publish dialog, you can deactivate it.
2. **Modify destination page**: You can easily alter the destination page where your posts are directed for publishing.
