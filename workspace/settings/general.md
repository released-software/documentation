## Basics

### Workspace name

Customize the name of your workspace. Make sure the name is descriptive and clearly identifies what updates you are aiming to communicate. Choose a name for your workspace that is descriptive and clearly reflects the updates you intend to communicate. Common examples include product names or team names. A well-chosen name helps team members quickly identify the workspace’s purpose and focus. names are product or team names.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This name is used both for your internal workspace and the portal you share with stakeholders and customers.
{% endhint %}

### Workspace description

Provide a brief description to help users understand the purpose of this workspace. This description appears both internally and externally, helping stakeholders and customers quickly grasp the focus and content of the portal.

### Linked projects

Workspaces are closely connected to Projects. Each workspace must have at least one linked project, but can be linked to multiple projects.

Linked projects do more than just create a connection; they determine:

* Access rights to restricted portals (see below)
* The projects used for filters
* Which projects are displayed in the portal

{% hint style="info" %}
If a workspace administrator lacks view permissions for a previously added project, the project name will be hidden.
{% endhint %}

### Delete workspace

Deleting a workspace moves it to the trash, where it will be permanently removed after 30 days.
