# Creating and Managing Posts

## Overview

Whether you are writing an update for a single change, or a release summary for the past week. Creating a post is easy and fast with Released.&#x20;

## Basics

### Creating a post

To create a new Post, click the **Create post** button in the top right corner of the Changelog page.

Next, select what issues you want to include in your post.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
A post can include issues from one or multiple projects. If you want to add additional projects, you can configure them in the [Changelog filter](changelog-filter.md) settings.
{% endhint %}

#### Available filters

Select which issues you want to include in the post.&#x20;

<table><thead><tr><th width="260.5">Filter</th><th>Description</th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Resolved since</strong> </td><td>Include issues resolved since a specific date.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Version</strong></td><td>Include issues with a specific version. </td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Label</strong></td><td>Include issues with a specific label.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Issue type</strong></td><td>Include specific types of issues.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Jira Filter</strong></td><td>Include issues that match a given <a href="https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/save-your-search-as-a-filter/">Jira filter</a>.  </td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

Click the **Get started** button to create a draft. &#x20;

### Updating a post

If you need to edit a post once [published](publishing.md), you can easily update the post.&#x20;

Simply click on **Edit** in on a post, make your changes and publish the post again.&#x20;

If you published a post to the wrong channel, you can disable the channel when updating the post, and it will be retracted from that channel.&#x20;

### Deleting a post

You can delete a post from via the post editor.&#x20;

* Click to edit a post.
* Click the **Unpublish** button in the top bar of the editor.
* Once unpublished, click the **Discard draft** button in the top bar of the editor to completely delete the post.&#x20;

### Drafts

When you create a new post or make edits to an existing one, a draft is automatically generated, ensuring that you can conveniently resume your work at a later time.

#### Editing a draft

To edit a previously created draft, navigate to the **Changelog** section in your [Space](../portals.md). All current drafts can be found at the top of the overview page.&#x20;

Click on a draft to start editing.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Drafts are only shown to users with edit permission in the linked project if access to the space is restricted. See [permissions ](../../permissions.md)for details.
{% endhint %}

#### Saving a draft

Drafts are saved automatically as you type.&#x20;

#### Deleting a draft

To delete a draft, click the **Discard draft** button in the top bar of the editor. Keep in mind that discarding a draft only deletes unpublished content.
