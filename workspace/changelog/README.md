## Overview

A Changelog is a document that contains a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project or product. Changelogs are used to communicate updates with internal stakeholders or customers. &#x20;

Released Changelogs make it easy to craft updates. Curate a list of issues related to a release in just a couple of clicks. Then let the AI copywriter transform your issue descriptions into a language that your target audience understands.

## Use-cases

Use the Changelog to communicate detail technical changes or high level marketing updates. What you want to communicate and how you communicate will determine the format and frequency.&#x20;

Some teams write multiple posts a day, each containing a single improvement. Other teams write a post once a week, summarising all improvements and bug-fixes in one Post.&#x20;

The Changelog is often used for:&#x20;

* Internal sprint summaries&#x20;
* Technical changelogs&#x20;
* Release notes
* Marketing updates
* Announcements
* And many more...

You can use [filters](staging-area.md) to only includes issues that are relevant and customize the [AI settings](artificial-intelligence.md) to tailor the prompt to your use-case.&#x20;
