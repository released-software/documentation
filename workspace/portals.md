Workspaces represent a communication channel for a product, team or for specific customers. Think of a workspace as your dedicated space to curate and tailor your product communication to a particular audience.

## Basics

Workspaces feature multiple modules that can be used to communicate your plans and progress.&#x20;

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th data-hidden data-card-cover data-type="files"></th><th data-hidden data-card-target data-type="content-ref"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><h3>Changelog</h3></td><td><a href="../.gitbook/assets/Changelog Cover Image.png">Changelog Cover Image.png</a></td><td><a href="changelog/">changelog</a></td></tr><tr><td><h3>Roadmap</h3></td><td><a href="../.gitbook/assets/Roadmap Cover Image.png">Roadmap Cover Image.png</a></td><td><a href="roadmap.md">roadmap.md</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

The changelog and roadmap help teams communicate updates as well as future plans.

Communication happens through the [Product Hub](../getting-started/concepts.md#product-hub), embedded [widgets](portal/widget.md) or [pages](portal/announcement-page.md), or third party communication channels such as [Confluence](settings/publishing/confluence.md), or [Slack](integrations/slack.md).

## How do workspaces relate to Jira projects?

Workspaces give teams greater flexibility to share their work in the way that suits them best.

**Example:**&#x20;

A product consists of 3 teams, each working in their own project.&#x20;

A workspace enables you to connect to all 3 projects and create a single changelog to communicate updates across all teams.&#x20;

Additionally, each team can have their own workspace to communicate progress internally via their team's changelog and roadmap.&#x20;
