### Troubleshooting

If you encounter a prolonged installation process or receive an indefinite error message in Jira, such as "We ran into a little trouble. It might just be a hiccup," there are a few common causes for this issue.&#x20;

It is typically related to either a missing or invalid payment method or an open quote (account in arrears). It's important to note that even though the Released trial, as well as your Jira trial or plan, may be free, Atlassian requires a valid payment method on file to initiate trials of third-party apps.

If you find yourself stuck in this situation, please don't hesitate to [contact us](https://released.so/support) for assistance.
