## Troubleshooting

<details>

<summary>Error during installation: "We ran into a little trouble. It might just be a hiccup"</summary>

If you encounter a prolonged installation process or receive an indefinite error message in Jira, such as "We ran into a little trouble. It might just be a hiccup," there are a few common causes for this issue.&#x20;

It is typically related to either a missing or invalid payment method or an open quote (account in arrears). It's important to note that even though the Released trial, as well as your Jira trial or plan, may be free, Atlassian requires a valid payment method on file to initiate trials of third-party apps.

<summary>Error loading the app: "Something went wrong" </summary>

When loading the app takes a long time and finally results in the above error, a couple of reasons could be the culprit.&#x20;

1. Your access token as expired – In that case simply reloading the page should fix the error.&#x20;
2. Your firewall might block our domain "released.so" – Although .so is a quite popular top level domain for startups, we've had a couple of customers who had to allow the domain.&#x20;

If none of the above works for you, please don't hesitate to [contact us](https://released.so/support) for assistance.
