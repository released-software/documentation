# Setup guide

## ① Add release notes to your site or app

Use the pop-up widget or announcement page to showcase your release notes on your website or in your application.&#x20;

{% content-ref url="../../product-tour/settings/widget.md" %}
[widget.md](../../product-tour/settings/widget.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../../product-tour/settings/announcement-page.md" %}
[announcement-page.md](../../product-tour/settings/announcement-page.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Or leverage one of the many integration to add release notes to your website via Framer, Webflow, Scroll Viewport and more.&#x20;

{% content-ref url="../../product-tour/integrations/" %}
[integrations](../../product-tour/integrations/)
{% endcontent-ref %}



## ② Add the custom description field (optional)

To view and edit the AI generated descriptions on the Jira ticket, add the **Released Description** custom field to the issue view.

{% content-ref url="released-description-field.md" %}
[released-description-field.md](released-description-field.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
