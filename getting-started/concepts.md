# Concepts

## Basic concepts

### ProductHub

The ProductHub is a central location listing all portals in your organization. The ProductHub can be accessed via the **Apps** menu item in Jira's top navigation bar.

### Portals

The ProductHub can contain one or many portals. Portals represent a communication channel for a product, team or for specific customers. Think of a portal as your dedicated space to curate and tailor your product communication to a particular audience.

Each portal is comes with a number of modules (features):&#x20;

* A Roadmap to effectively communicate your plans
* A Changelog to share updates

### Changelog

A Changelog is a log or record of all notable changes made to a project. The project is often a website or software project, and the changelog usually includes records of changes such as bug fixes, new features, etc.&#x20;

Changelogs serve various purposes, catering to different stakeholders and objectives within a project. They can be utilized for:

1. Detailed Project Updates: Changelogs provide a comprehensive overview of tasks accomplished and bug fixes implemented, offering transparency and insight into the project's development process.
2. Educational Updates: They serve as a valuable resource for sales and other go-to-market teams, informing them about upcoming features and enhancements. This ensures alignment across teams and prepares them to effectively communicate with clients or users.
3. High-Level Marketing Updates: Changelogs can also be repurposed as high-level marketing updates, suitable for sharing with customers either within the application itself or on the project's website. This allows customers to stay informed about the latest improvements and developments, fostering trust and engagement.

### Roadmap views

Unlike the Timeline view or Plans (formerly known as Advanced Roadmaps) in Jira, Released Roadmap views are specifically designed for effectively communicating plans to stakeholders and customers.

Roadmap views in Released are cross-project. This allows teams to consolidate multiple plans into a single, cohesive roadmap while maintaining the flexibility to organize work the way they prefer.

### Portal

The Portal is your central hub for publishing plans and updates. Easily embed it in your website or app, and link it to Jira projects for quick access by anyone viewing the project.
