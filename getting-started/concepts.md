# Concepts

## Basic Concepts

### Workspace

Workspaces are your internal control center. This is where your team creates roadmap views, writes release notes, and manages feedback — all directly linked to your Jira Spaces. You decide what gets published and how it’s presented.

A single workspace can be linked to _one or many Jira Spaces_, giving you the flexibility to keep communication independent of how your teams or Spaces are structured.

### Portals

Portals are the external-facing side of Released. They’re where you share the content created in a workspace with a specific audience. This could be internal stakeholders, such as sales and marketing teams, or your customers.&#x20;

Each portal can include three core features:

* **Roadmaps** to communicate what’s coming next
* **Feedback** to collect input and insights from your audience
* **Changelog** to share product updates

Portals can be accessed through your Product Hub, or embedded directly into your website or app.

### Product Hub

The Product Hub serves as a central hub for accessing your portals. It can be reached at `your_subdomain.releasedhub.com` or through a custom domain if configured.

## Core features

### Changelog

A Changelog is a log or record of all notable changes made to a project. The project is often a website or software project, and the changelog usually includes records of changes such as bug fixes, new features, etc.&#x20;

Changelogs serve various purposes, catering to different stakeholders and objectives within a project. They can be utilized for:

1. Detailed Project Updates: Changelogs provide a comprehensive overview of tasks accomplished and bug fixes implemented, offering transparency and insight into the project's development process.
2. Educational Updates: They serve as a valuable resource for sales and other go-to-market teams, informing them about upcoming features and enhancements. This ensures alignment across teams and prepares them to effectively communicate with clients or users.
3. High-Level Marketing Updates: Changelogs can also be repurposed as high-level marketing updates, suitable for sharing with customers either within the application itself or on the project's website. This allows customers to stay informed about the latest improvements and developments, fostering trust and engagement.

### Roadmap

Unlike the Timeline view or Plans (formerly known as Advanced Roadmaps) in Jira, Released Roadmap views are specifically designed for effectively communicating plans to stakeholders and customers.

Roadmap views in Released can span multiple Jira Spaces. This allows teams to consolidate multiple plans into a single, cohesive roadmap while maintaining the flexibility to organize work the way they prefer.

### Feedback

Feedback helps you understand what your users and stakeholders care about. It brings all input into one place so you can spot themes, validate ideas and guide your roadmap with real signals.

Feedback can come from many places. Users can leave comments on your roadmap items, ideas and post in your Product Hub. They can also add items to their [wishlist](../product/feedback/wishlists.md), giving you a clear view of what matters most to them.

### Inbox

The Inbox is your central place to review, organize and act on all incoming feedback. It brings every signal together so you can quickly understand what users are telling you and decide what deserves attention.

From the Inbox, you can link feedback to work items, ideas or opportunities and decide what should influence your roadmap.&#x20;

### Wishlist

The Wishlist shows you what users want most. It captures the ideas, features and improvements that people actively choose to follow, giving you a direct signal of demand.

Users can add roadmap items, ideas or opportunities to their wishlist from your a portal. When something matters to them, they ❤️ it — and you see the collective weight of those preferences on the wished for work item.

The Wishlist helps you understand which themes are gaining traction, which ideas resonate and where expectations are shifting. It works alongside Feedback and the Inbox to give you a complete picture of customer interest and priority.
