### Workspace

Workspaces are where you write release notes and create roadmap views to share with your stakeholders or customers. They act as a control center, letting you decide exactly what gets shared and with whom.

### Product Hub

The Product Hub serves as a central hub for accessing your portals. It can be reached at `your_subdomain.releasedhub.com` or through a custom domain if configured.

### Portals

Portals represent a communication channel for a product, team or specific customers. Think of a portal as your dedicated space to communicate with a particular audience.

Each portal features two modules:&#x20;

* **Changelog** – to share updates
* **Roadmap** – to effectively communicate your plans

Portals can be accessed by users via the Product Hub, or embedded into your website or app.&#x20;

### Changelog

A Changelog is a log or record of all notable changes made to a project. The project is often a website or software project, and the changelog usually includes records of changes such as bug fixes, new features, etc.&#x20;

Changelogs serve various purposes, catering to different stakeholders and objectives within a project. They can be utilized for:

1. Detailed Project Updates: Changelogs provide a comprehensive overview of tasks accomplished and bug fixes implemented, offering transparency and insight into the project's development process.
2. Educational Updates: They serve as a valuable resource for sales and other go-to-market teams, informing them about upcoming features and enhancements. This ensures alignment across teams and prepares them to effectively communicate with clients or users.
3. High-Level Marketing Updates: Changelogs can also be repurposed as high-level marketing updates, suitable for sharing with customers either within the application itself or on the project's website. This allows customers to stay informed about the latest improvements and developments, fostering trust and engagement.

### Roadmap

Unlike the Timeline view or Plans (formerly known as Advanced Roadmaps) in Jira, Released Roadmap views are specifically designed for effectively communicating plans to stakeholders and customers.

Roadmap views in Released are cross-project. This allows teams to consolidate multiple plans into a single, cohesive roadmap while maintaining the flexibility to organize work the way they prefer.
