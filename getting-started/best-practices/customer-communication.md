# Customer Communication

## Set up a Portal for your audience

A Portal gives customers a dedicated space to see updates, roadmaps, and provide feedback. Tailoring it to the right audience ensures messaging is relevant and actionable.

#### Best practices

* Create a separate Portal for each target audience (e.g., public customers, enterprise customers, or key accounts).
* [Apply branding](../../product/portals/portal/) to make the Portal feel familiar and professional. Customize logos, colors, and naming.
* [Configure access](../../product/portals/access.md) and verification settings so the right users can view and interact with the Portal without friction.

## Build a clear Roadmap

A public roadmap helps customers see what’s coming next and understand your priorities, which reduces uncertainty and builds trust. It also aligns expectations, reduces repetitive support questions, and demonstrates transparency by showing that customer feedback is considered. Sharing your roadmap gives customers confidence that work is actively happening and priorities are thoughtfully managed, while also inviting feedback to validate demand before investing in development.

#### Best practices

* Use Now / Next / Later columns to organize your initiatives and communicate priorities clearly:
  * **Now**: Work that is actively in progress or about to be released. This shows customers and stakeholders what they can expect imminently.
  * **Next**: Initiatives planned for the near term. These items are on the horizon and give visibility into what’s coming after current priorities.
  * **Later**: Ideas or initiatives under consideration. This helps signal longer-term thinking without committing to a timeline.
  * **Exploring**: An optional column or separate board for concepts you’re investigating but aren’t ready to commit to. Sharing these shows transparency and invites feedback early, while keeping the main roadmap focused on tangible priorities.
* Keep your roadmap focused on initiatives planned for the next 12 months, rather than speculative work that might happen years from now.
* Prioritize clarity over detail. High-level initiatives are more valuable than listing every single task.
* Update your roadmap regularly to reflect changes in priorities, timelines, or delivery dates.

### Enable Feedback

Feedback gives customers a voice and provides signals about what matters most to them. It also creates engagement and strengthens your relationship.

#### Best practices

* [Enable the Feedback](../../product/feedback/) module in your workspace so users can submit ideas, comment on roadmap items, and add things to their [Wishlist](../../product/feedback/wishlists.md).
* Use [feedback visibility](../../product/feedback/settings.md#feedback-visibility) to match your requirements
  * Make feedback accessible **everyone** to create a community feel.
  * Make feedback only accessible to the **author** and your team to keep feedback private.&#x20;
* Monitor the [Inbox](../../product/feedback/inbox.md) regularly to respond and link feedback to roadmap items or ideas.&#x20;
* [Limit the number of wishes](../../product/feedback/settings.md#maximum-wishes-per-user) to force customers and stakeholder to prioritize.

### Publish Release Notes

Release Notes keep customers informed about what’s changed, showing progress and demonstrating responsiveness to their needs.

#### Best practices

* Use the Changelog module to publish updates for every release.
* Keep notes concise, outcome-focused, and easy to scan.&#x20;
* Focus on one or two key features, followed by a list of small improvements and bugfixes.&#x20;
* For major releases with more features, aim to have a theme and a story to tie it all together.&#x20;
* For stakeholder updates, link keep the related work item visible to provide context where required.
* Consider adding images or GIFs for more visual impact and clarity.
* Bonus: Add a Loom showcasing a feature.&#x20;

### Keep a consistent cadence

Regular updates maintain engagement, build trust, and ensure your communication doesn’t feel ad-hoc.

#### Best practices

* Publish release notes at predictable intervals (e.g., weekly or monthly).
* Update your roadmap frequently (a great habit is to update the roadmap alongside your release notes)
* Monitor and respond to feedback in the Inbox daily to ensure signals are captured and acted upon.
