# Customer Communication

## Set up a Portal for your audience

A Portal gives customers a dedicated space to see updates, roadmaps, and provide feedback. Tailoring it to the right audience ensures messaging is relevant and actionable.

#### Best practices

* Create a separate Portal for each target audience (e.g., public customers, enterprise customers, or key accounts).
* [Apply branding](../../product/portals/portal/) to make the Portal feel familiar and professional. Customize logos, colors, and naming.
* Configure access and verification settings so the right users can view and interact with the Portal without friction.
