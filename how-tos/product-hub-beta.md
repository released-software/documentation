### Setting up your Product Hub

Once enabled, your Product Hub will become available on a subdomain of releasedhub.com. We do plan to support custom domains in the future.&#x20;

#### Changing the look and feel&#x20;

You can change the look and feel of the Product Hub via two settings:&#x20;

1. The global settings, which will let you customize the Product Hub overview page
2. The Portal settings, which will let you customize the look and feel of each portal.&#x20;

#### Changing the visibility&#x20;

Currently, the Product Hub doesn't allow access control for each portal individually. Our team is actively working to add this feature soon.&#x20;

Meanwhile, you can decide if a portal is visible on the Product Hub overview page. Note that unlisted portals can still be accessed directly through their URL.

#### Overview video

We have created a quick overview to guide you through the new settings.&#x20;
