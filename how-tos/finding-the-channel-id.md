# Finding the Channel ID

## What is the channel ID?&#x20;

The channel-id uniquely identifies an announcement channel. Since posts can be published to individual channels, for example to the in-app widget or the website, each channel has it's own ID.&#x20;

## Where can I find the channel ID?

* Navigate to the Released **Settings** in your Jira project
* Select **Announcement Page** or **Widget** in the Channels section (depending on which channel you want to integrate)
* Find the channel ID in the **Installation Instructions**
