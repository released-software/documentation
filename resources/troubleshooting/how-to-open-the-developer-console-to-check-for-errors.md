# How to Open the developer console to check for errors

If you encounter issues with viewing or interacting with web page elements like drop-down menus or buttons, we may ask you to check your browser's console for JavaScript errors. Use the following shortcuts to open the developer console in your browser.

### Windows <a href="#id-01h7zwdzpsxyes035523t2tpxj" id="id-01h7zwdzpsxyes035523t2tpxj"></a>

**Chrome:** `Ctrl + Shift + J`

**Firefox:** `Ctrl + Shift + K`

**Internet Explorer**: F12 key or right click and select Inspect element

### Mac <a href="#id-01h7zwdzps4wp6h3vh49vbzzca" id="id-01h7zwdzps4wp6h3vh49vbzzca"></a>

**Chrome:** `Cmd + Opt + J`

**Firefox:** `Cmd + Opt + K`

Once you've clicked the keyboard shortcuts, you'll see the web console window at the bottom of your browser. Make sure the **Console** tab is selected and then open or refresh the web page you were having trouble with. Take a screenshot of what you can see and share it via email or your support ticket.&#x20;
