[^1]: Yes, roadmaps are coming to the Released App

[^2]: Allow users to subscribe to roadmap updates via email.

[^3]: Released will offer a standalone portal page, eliminating the need to hassle your developers to embed the widget into your app or website when getting started. \
    \
    We still recommend to use the embeds for a tighter integration of your overall product experience and communicate updates in-app to all your users.&#x20;

[^4]: Automatically generate and publish release notes.&#x20;

[^5]: Stay tuned for more information coming soon!

[^6]: Create standardized templates that magically populate themselves from your issue data. \
    \
    This makes writing updates even faster and ensures a standard format for all your updates.&#x20;



[^7]: Customize the look and feel of your widget and announcement page through the UI settings instead of code parameters.&#x20;

[^8]: Support publishing of posts in multiple languages.&#x20;

[^9]: Add Confluence as a channel and allows users to publish updates directly to Confluence.

[^10]: Change the publish date of a post.

[^11]: Support Jira filters to narrow down the list of issues for the release notes.

[^12]: Allow users to specify custom prompts for generating descriptions.



[^13]: Instead of using the post ID, deep links  will use the post title for nicer URLs and better SEO.

[^14]: This feature will add a version field to the release notes that is pre-filled with versions picked for issue selection, but can also be manually edited by the author of the post.

[^15]: This feature allows for creating release notes that include features and improvements from multiple Jira projects. For example a product might be split into multiple projects for different platforms (mobile, desktop...)

[^16]: Allow users to limit the issues shown in the staging area to specific issue types.&#x20;

[^17]: Support cropping and re-sizing and positioning of images for the cover and content.&#x20;

[^18]: Share your latest announcements on your website or in your documentation with a full sized release notes page.

[^19]: [Allow users to filter posts by category. Categories can determine the type of post (new features, security or platforms like mobile or desktop).](#user-content-fn-20)[^20]
