# How to Apply Atlassian Marketplace App Promo Codes for Cloud

On Atlassian’s new billing experience, billing admins add Marketplace app promo codes from the billing portal. Go to admin.atlassian.com/billing, choose your billing account, open Subscriptions, find the app, click Manage, then More actions and select Enter promo code. The discount starts on the next billing cycle once validated. [​⁠](https://support.atlassian.com/subscriptions-and-billing/docs/apply-a-promo-code-to-an-app-purchase/)

If you’re on annual billing in the new system, the self-serve option may not appear. Submit a support ticket with your site, entitlement number, app name, and code for Atlassian to apply it.
