# Finding the Channel ID

## What is the channel ID?&#x20;

The channel-id uniquely identifies an announcement channel. Since posts can be published to individual channels, for example to the in-app widget or the website, each channel has it's own ID.&#x20;

## Where can I find the channel ID?

* Navigate to the **Settings** in your Released workspace (accessible via the left-hand navigation)&#x20;
* Select **Widge** or **Page** in the Design section (depending on how you want to embed your portal)
* Click on the **Install** button at the bottom right.&#x20;
* You will find the **Channel ID** near the top of the instructions.&#x20;
