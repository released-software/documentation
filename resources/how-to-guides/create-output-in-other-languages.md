# ðŸ¤– Create output in other languages

## Overview

The AI models are optimized for use in English, but many of them are robust enough to generate good results for a variety of languages.\
\
We have seen good results in the following languages:&#x20;

* Chinese (zh-Hans)
* Chinese (zh-TW)
* French (fr-FR)
* German (de-DE)
* Italian (it-IT)
* Japanese (ja-JP)
* Portuguese (pt-BR)
* Russian (ru-RU)
* Spanish (es-ES)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that depending on the complexity of the prompt and the input, the quality of results may vary and it is possible that the language model falls back to English.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Basics

    Within the settings, find the option for **Artificial Intelligence**.
3.  **Choose custom prompt**

    Look for the **Base prompt** settings and choose **Custom**.
