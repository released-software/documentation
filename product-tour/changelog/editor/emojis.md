# Emojis

## Overview

Did you know you’ve got an emoji keyboard at your fingertips? Emojis are readily available on Windows and OSX anywhere you edit text. Making it easy to add a bit of fun to your changelog. Here is how:

## Basics

### Windows

1. During text entry, type `Windows logo key  + .(period)` The emoji keyboard will appear.
2. Select an emoji with the mouse, or keep typing to search through the available emojis for one you like.

For more ways to express yourself, choose from GIFs and Kaomoji too!

### OSX

1. Press `Fn + E`, or choose Edit > Emoji & Symbols.
2. Click a character or symbol to add it to your text (or double-click it if the Character Viewer is expanded).

To quickly find a specific emoji, enter a word or phrase (such as “laughing face”) in the search field.\
To see variations of an emoji — like different skin tones — click and hold the emoji in the viewer.

**↳ Pro tip**: Try typing a word such as “like” and click the `Fn` button to see emoji suggestions appear.
