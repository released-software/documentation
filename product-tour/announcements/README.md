# Announcements

Announcements allow you to keep your users informed about new features, product updates, or any other important news. You can create an announcement for a single feature or topic, or use it to communicate a list of changes included in a new product release. The choice is yours â€“ Announcements give you the flexibility to communicate with your customers in the way that works best for you.

Announcements allow you to keep your users up-to-date with the latest changes and updates to your product. Whether you want to announce a new feature, highlight a product change, or simply make an announcement, Announcements make it easy to get the message out.

### Reach your users where they are

When it comes to publishing product updates and announcements, using multiple channels is key to keeping your users in the loop. By using an in-app widget, a release page, and emails, you can reach your users where they are and ensure they're always up-to-date with the latest changes.&#x20;

#### In-App Widget

An in-app widget is perfect for users who are actively using your product. Users can quickly and easily see any relevant news while they use your product, without being bombarded with notifications or emails.

#### Release page

The release page provides a comprehensive overview of all the changes made in one place.  Using a dedicated release page to showcase your latest product updates can help you build credibility and trust with your customers. By keeping a clear and organized history of your product releases, you show your users that you're constantly working to improve your product and that you take their feedback seriously.&#x20;

#### Email (coming soon)

And for users who may not be as active, sending an email is a great way to get their attention and keep them engaged.&#x20;

By using multiple channels, you can make sure your message is heard loud and clear, and reach a wider audience in the process.&#x20;
