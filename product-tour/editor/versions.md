# Versions

If you are building software that gets installed by your users, whether they are desktop, mobile or server apps, it's likely that you release them as versions. To help communicate what changes made it into which version, Released allows you to specify a version when writing a post.&#x20;

## Setting the version

If you are using the [version filter](staging-area.md#filter) to create your post, the version field will automatically be populated with the version used in the filter. But don't worry, you can always change the version by simply editing the version field.&#x20;

To edit the version, click on the version field above the title and type in the version for this release.&#x20;
