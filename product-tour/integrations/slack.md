## Sharing a post to Slack

Sharing a post to Slack will post the entire content, not just a link, to the selected Slack channels. Allowing users to read the update right within Slack.&#x20;

Sharing a post to Slack only takes a couple of clicks.&#x20;

1. Click on the **Share** button when hovering over any post
2. Select the workspace where you want to share the post
3. Select the Slack channel(s) to share to
4. Click **Post** to share&#x20;

The workspace and channel settings will be remembered. If you are frequently sharing updates to the same workspace and channels, all you need to do next time is hit **Post**.

**What is the difference between publishing and sharing?**

When publishing posts to the widget, page or Confluence, you can continue to edit and update the same post by publishing it again. \
\
Sharing a post is a one time action. Content posted to Slack can not be unpublished or updated from within Released.&#x20;
