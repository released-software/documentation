# Aura / Karma for Confluence

[Aura ](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1221974/aura-content-formatting-macros-tabs-miro-figma-google-html?hosting=cloud\&tab=overview)is the top rated formatting app that allows users to create visually appealing and engaging content in Confluence with a suite of intuitive macros, highlighting important content, providing intuitive navigation, and enhancing readability.

Additionally, Aura offers a free expansion called [Karma](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1228839/karma-confluence-page-builder-content-formatting-free?hosting=cloud\&tab=overview), which is a simple WYSIWYG page builder that enables users to create engaging Confluence pages quickly using various templates.

## Integrating Released with Aura / Karma
