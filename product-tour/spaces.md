# Spaces

## Overview

The Product Hub contains one or many Spaces. Spaces typically represent products, teams, projects or even a group of customers. Think of a space as your dedicated area to curate and tailor your product communication to a particular audience.

## Basics

Each Space contains the following features:

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th data-hidden data-card-cover data-type="files"></th><th data-hidden data-card-target data-type="content-ref"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><h3>Changelog</h3></td><td><a href="../.gitbook/assets/Changelog Cover Image.png">Changelog Cover Image.png</a></td><td><a href="changelog/">changelog</a></td></tr><tr><td><h3>Roadmap</h3></td><td><a href="../.gitbook/assets/Roadmap Cover Image.png">Roadmap Cover Image.png</a></td><td><a href="roadmap.md">roadmap.md</a></td></tr><tr><td><h3>Portal</h3></td><td><a href="../.gitbook/assets/Portal Cover Image.png">Portal Cover Image.png</a></td><td><a href="portal.md">portal.md</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

The Changelog and Roadmap help teams communicate updates as well as future plans.

Communication happens through the Space's Portal, or additional communication channels such as [Confluence](settings/confluence.md), or [Slack](integrations/slack.md).

### How do Spaces compare to Jira projects?

Spaces give teams more flexibility to organise their work the way it suits them best, and still communicate holistically.&#x20;

For example, a product might be broken down into 3 teams, each working in their own project. A Space enables you to connect to all 3 projects and create a single Changelog to communicate updates across all projects.&#x20;

Additionally, each team can have their own Space to communicate progress internally via their team's Changelog.&#x20;
