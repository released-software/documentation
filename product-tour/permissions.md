# Permissions

Released integrates tightly with the permission system of Jira, removing the burden of setting up additional roles or access controls to draft and publish release notes.&#x20;

Released uses the following Jira permissions for access control:



<table><thead><tr><th width="219">Permission</th><th>Required for</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Browse projects</strong></td><td>Viewing the release notes page within a project.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Edit issues</strong></td><td>Editing and publishing a post. </td></tr><tr><td><strong>Administer projects</strong></td><td>Setting up the <strong>Released Description</strong> custom field.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Jira administrators</strong></td><td>Installing the Released App.</td></tr></tbody></table>
