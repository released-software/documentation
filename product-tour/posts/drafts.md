### Creating a draft

When you create a new post or make edits to an existing one, a draft is automatically generated, ensuring that you can conveniently resume your work at a later time.

### Editing a draft

To edit a previously created draft, navigate to the **Release Notes** section in your Jira project. All current drafts can be found in the right-hand side toolbar.

Click on a draft to start editing it.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Drafts are only shown to users with edit permission on the project.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Saving a draft

Drafts are saved automatically as you type.&#x20;

### Deleting a draft

To delete a draft, click the **Discard draft** button in the top bar of the editor. Keep in mind that discarding a draft only deletes unpublished content. If you want to delete a post, first **Unpublish** the post and then delete the draft.
