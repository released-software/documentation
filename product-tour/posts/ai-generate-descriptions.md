# AI Generate Descriptions

Released takes the summary and description of your Jira issues and turns them into copy for your announcement.&#x20;

### Generating a description

First, [create](creating-a-post.md) or edit a post.&#x20;

Then select one ore more issues in the [staging area](staging-area.md) of the post editing view. Once selected, an action toolbar will appear at the bottom-centre of the editor (see image below. Click the **Generate** button to generate the descriptions for the selected issues.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The generation of descriptions is **limited to a maximum of 50 issues** at a time. In case you have a larger number of issues, it is recommended to select and generate the descriptions in smaller batches.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Editing the generated description

If you have the **Released Description** custom field configured for your issues, you will be able to see and edit the generated description in the issue view.&#x20;

If the **Released Description** custom field is not configured, the generated description will be saved as an issue property and cannot be edited through the issue view. Nevertheless, you can still modify the generated text by simply dragging and dropping the card into the release notes editor.
