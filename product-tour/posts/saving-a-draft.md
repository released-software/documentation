When writing an announcement, a draft is automatically created for you. That way you can come back later and pick up where you left off.&#x20;

### Editing a draft

To edit a previously created draft, go to the Release Notes section in your Jira project. You can find all current drafts in the right-hand side toolbar.&#x20;

Simply click on the draft to start editing it.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Drafts are only shown to users with edit permission on the project.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Saving a draft

Drafts are saved automatically.&#x20;
