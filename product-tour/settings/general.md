## Basics

### Changelog page

#### Portal name

Customize the name of your portal. Make sure the name is descriptive and clearly identifies what updates you are aiming to communicate. This name is **only used internally** and doesn't show on the portal or embedded pages or widgets.&#x20;

### Linked projects

Portals are tightly interwoven with Projects. For that reason, each portals must have at least one linked project, but can also be linked to multiple projects.&#x20;

But linked projects provide more than a simple link to projects. They determine:&#x20;

* Access rights to the portals, if restricted (see below)
* Default projects used for filters&#x20;
* Which projects the portal's changelog will be displayed in

{% hint style="info" %}
If a project administrator does not have view permission for a previously added project, the project name will be obfuscated.
{% endhint %}

### Access&#x20;

A portal can be either:

* **Open**, everyone with access to the Jira site can view and edit content in the portal.&#x20;
* **Restricted**, only users with access to the linked Jira project(s) can view and edit content in this portal, depending on their level of access in the Jira project(s).&#x20;

For more details on access and the required Jira permissions. See the [Permissions](permissions.md) guide.

### Delete portal

Deleting this portal will move it to the trash. It will be permanently removed after 30 days.&#x20;
