## Basics

### Changelog page

#### Name

Customize the name of your changelog page. Make sure the name is descriptive and clearly identifies what these posts are about. This name is only used internally and doesn't show on the embedded widget or page.&#x20;

### Projects

With the **Projects** setting, you can easily consolidate issues from multiple Jira projects into a unified Release Notes page. This feature provides teams with the flexibility to organize their their work in a project structure that suits them best while effortlessly pulling everything together for a comprehensive release documentation.

To include issues from multiple projects&#x20;

1. Click the multi-select project dropdown to expand the dropdown list.
2. Review the list of available projects and select the ones that you want to include in your Release Notes.&#x20;
3. Your selection will be automatically saved.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If a project administrator does not have view permission for a previously added project, the project name will be masked or hidden using `******.`
{% endhint %}
