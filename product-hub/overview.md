As the name implies, we created the Product Hub specifically for product teams that want to keep stakeholders informed—think sales and marketing teams, executives, customer success, or even external customers.&#x20;

Presenting a product roadmap once a quarter is a antiquated way of working. Things are constantly changing and teams need to move fast, which requires a much tighter collaboration loop with stakeholders. That’s what the Product Hub creates.

## How does the Product Hub work?

The Product Hub consists of one or many portals, each representing a product, team, project, or specific communication channel like “Customer updates”.

Each portal features a **Changelog** for sharing updates and a **Roadmap** for outlining future plans.

Product teams can easily publish new changelog updates, automatically generated from existing Jira tickets using AI. They can also publish roadmap changes with a single click, all within Jira and always in sync.

## Accessing the Product Hub

You can access your Product Hub under _<mark style="background-color:yellow;">your\_subdomain</mark>_<mark style="background-color:yellow;">.releasedhub.com</mark>, where _your\_subdomain_ is the same subdomain as your Jira instance. Support for custom domains is coming soon!
