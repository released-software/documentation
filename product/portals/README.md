# Workspaces & Portals

## Overview

Workspaces are your internal control center. This is where your team creates roadmap views, writes release notes, and manages feedback — all directly linked to your Jira projects. You decide what gets published and how it’s presented.

Portals are the external-facing side of Released. They’re where you share the content created in a workspace with your customers or stakeholders. Each portal represents a specific communication channel — for a product, team, or even a select group of customers.

A single workspace can be linked to one or many projects, giving you the flexibility to keep communication independent of how your teams or projects are structured.

Portals can be shared via the Product Hub, or embedded directly into your website or app for seamless access.

## Workspace settings

### Logo

Uploading a logo helps personalize your workspace and create a consistent brand identity. Your logo will appear in your internal workspace as well as on your portal.

### Workspace name

Customize the name of your workspace. Make sure the name is descriptive and clearly identifies what updates you are aiming to communicate. Choose a name for your workspace that is descriptive and clearly reflects the updates you intend to communicate. Common examples include product names or team names. A well-chosen name helps team members quickly identify the workspace’s purpose and focus. names are product or team names.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This name is used both for your internal workspace and the portal you share with stakeholders and customers.
{% endhint %}

### Workspace description

Provide a brief description to help users understand the purpose of this workspace. This description appears both internally and externally, helping stakeholders and customers quickly grasp the focus and content of the portal.

### Linked projects

Workspaces are closely connected to Projects. Each workspace must have at least one linked project, but can be linked to multiple projects.

Linked projects do more than just create a connection; they determine:

* Access rights to restricted portals (see below)
* The projects used for filters
* Which projects are displayed in the portal

{% hint style="info" %}
If a workspace administrator lacks view permissions for a previously added project, the project name will be hidden.
{% endhint %}

### Delete a workspace

Deleting a workspace moves it to the trash, where it will be permanently removed after 30 days.

## Frequently asked questions

<details>

<summary>How do workspaces relate to Jira spaces (projects)?</summary>

A workspace in Released can be linked to one or multiple Jira projects. This gives you the flexibility to organize your teams and internal structure however you like — without exposing that setup to your customers. Your stakeholders see a clean, curated view, while your team works directly from Jira.

**Example:**&#x20;

A product consists of 3 teams, each working in their own project.&#x20;

A workspace enables you to connect to all 3 projects and create a single changelog to communicate updates across all teams.&#x20;

Additionally, each team can have their own workspace to communicate progress internally via their team's changelog and roadmap.&#x20;
