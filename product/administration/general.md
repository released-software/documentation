The Product Hub is the central access points to all portals in your organization. You can customize the name, basic links and subdomain via the General settings.

## Basics

### Product Hub name

Customize the name of your Product Hub—it’s typically the name of your company or product.

### Website URL

Specify the website the Product Hub logo should link to, typically your company’s or product’s website.

### Custom domain

Add a custom subdomain to host your Product Hub on your own domain, giving users a branded and seamless way to access and interact with your portals under an easily recognizable web address.

Read the [custom-domain.md](custom-domain.md "mention") documentation for detailed instructions on how to set it up.&#x20;
