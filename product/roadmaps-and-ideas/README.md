## Overview

Create internal or customer-facing roadmap views directly from your Jira issues. Customize the view by selecting the fields to display and adding detailed descriptions of your plans. Since the data is stored on the issue, your view will always be up to date.

## Use-cases

Use Roadmap views to communicate plans to customers or stakeholders. Released roadmaps are highly flexible and can work across projects, enabling you to consolidate work from various teams as needed.

Released roadmaps are perfect for:

* Public roadmaps
* High touch customer communication &#x20;
* Stakeholder updates
