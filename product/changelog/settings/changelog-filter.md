2. Review the list of available projects and select the ones that you want to include in your Release Notes.&#x20;
3. Your selection will be automatically saved.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If a project administrator does not have view permission for a previously added project, the project name will be obfuscated.
{% endhint %}

### Version field

Select which version field to use when filtering by version. The field defaults to the standard "Fix versions", but allows you to specify any custom single or multi-version field.&#x20;
