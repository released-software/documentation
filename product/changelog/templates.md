<details>

<summary>What happens if an issue in the template already has a description?</summary>

That depends.

**If the description is stored in a** [released-description-field.md](../../getting-started/setup-guide/released-description-field.md "mention"): Released will use that description in the template and not generate a new description.

**If the description is stored in the issue properties (the default)**: Released will overwrite the description only if a **custom prompt** was used in the template. &#x20;
